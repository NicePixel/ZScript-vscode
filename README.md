# zscript README

ZScript language extension for vscode.

## !! UNMAINTAINED !!
If you have knowledge of Visual Studio Code's extension API, feel free to use any part of this repository for writing a better extension. I don't have time nor will to fix this mess of code I wrote.

## Features

* Autocomplete for most of the functions and constants. The extension doesn't know context, it shows everything it knows.
* Colour tinting of keywords and functions.
* Certain short snippets for creating a new Actor, `tg` as an alias to `Tan`...
